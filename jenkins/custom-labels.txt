# This files contains a list of labels to select what to do when building a commit in CI.
# Each label must go on a separate line.
# Lines starting with a hash are comments.
#
# ⚠️ Important: Do not merge this file into main (or any other release branch) if it has any labels in it ⚠️
#
# This is used when building in CI to adjust what we build when we're building
# a branch (since we can't apply labels to branches), but if any labels are
# merged into main, that adjustment will be permanent, and that's most likely
# not what we want. For this reason, replace any empty comment line with labels,
# so that a merge attempt into main will fail with conflicts.
#
# ℹ️ Remove any empty comment lines with labels ℹ️
