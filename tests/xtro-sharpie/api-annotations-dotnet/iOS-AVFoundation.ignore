## no generator support for NSFastEnumeration / https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=4391
!missing-protocol-conformance! AVCaptureSynchronizedDataCollection should conform to NSFastEnumeration

## https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/3213 should be fixed before conformance to 'AVQueuedSampleBufferRendering' is restored.
!missing-protocol-conformance! AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer should conform to AVQueuedSampleBufferRendering (defined in 'AVSampleBufferDisplayLayerQueueManagement' category)

## deprecated in all iOS versions we support, and there's a viable alternative to use instead.
!missing-protocol-member! AVAudioRecorderDelegate::audioRecorderEndInterruption:withFlags: not found

## this API is to have cute Objective-C syntax for something that's (according to the docs) identical to what another method does (which we've bound).
!missing-selector! AVCaptureSynchronizedDataCollection::objectForKeyedSubscript: not bound

### deprecated in iOS8
!missing-protocol-member! AVAudioPlayerDelegate::audioPlayerEndInterruption:withFlags: not found

## https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/16229 prevents crashing instead of return null
## so these selectors have been bound manually
!missing-selector! AVAudioPlayer::initWithContentsOfURL:error: not bound
!missing-selector! AVAudioPlayer::initWithData:error: not bound
