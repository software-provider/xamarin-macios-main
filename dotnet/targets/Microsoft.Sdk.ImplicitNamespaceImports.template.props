	This file is imported by AutoImport.props, and will be imported by all
	projects using Microsoft.NET.Sdk.  All Item includes in this file *MUST*
	be hidden behind a TargetPlatformIdentifier based condition.

	This file can also not define any properties. However, due to the
	order MSBuild evaluates properties, it's possible to use properties
	defined in our .targets files in conditions in ItemGroups in this
	file.
