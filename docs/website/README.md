This directory contains documentation files in markdown format.

They are included here to **ensure** any changes to

* Tools error codes;
* Binding attributes;
* Binding usage

are documented immediately, i.e. in the same commit that the change was introduced.

This also allows any contributor from the community to enhance the documentation with a pull-request.

The `Makefile` can be used to copy the files into the documentation repo.
Once reviewed locally it can be merged just before the release.
