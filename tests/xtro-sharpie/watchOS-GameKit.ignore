## All members of the protocol are marked as not available on watchOS (but the protocols themselves are not decorated)
!missing-protocol! GKChallengeListener not bound
!missing-protocol! GKInviteEventListener not bound

## enum size declared after the enum, e.g. `typedef NSInteger GKPhotoSize;`, so we miss the metadata
!unknown-native-enum! GKPhotoSize bound

## types/members marked as deprecated in watchOS 2.0 (even if the framework was not available before 3.0)
## or deprecated well before that (and have alternatives). The last ones might be there but it seems better
## to avoid exposing them (since they might be removed later) as better API exists
!missing-protocol-member! GKTurnBasedEventListener::player:didRequestMatchWithPlayers: not found

# API removed by Apple, marked as deprecated
!unknown-native-enum! GKAuthenticationType bound
