       There's no way to execute a task (for instance to calculate the arguments to mlaunch) in "dotnet run",
       so we rely on the 'Run' target instead. Quite ugly, but it seems to work, even though it won't support
       "dotnet run" flags such as /no-build. OTOH we try to support /configuration and /runtime.
