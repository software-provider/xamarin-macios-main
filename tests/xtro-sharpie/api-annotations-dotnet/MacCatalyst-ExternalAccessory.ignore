## web docs <quote>On Apple silicon, this method displays an alert to let the user know that the Bluetooth accessory picker is unavailable.</quote>
## since the base description is for iOS (and the API is not available on macOS) it's not clear what happens on Intel macOS ?!?
!missing-selector! EAAccessoryManager::showBluetoothAccessoryPickerWithNameFilter:completion: not bound

## This is documented to be a designated initializer https://developer.apple.com/documentation/externalaccessory/eawifiunconfiguredaccessorybrowser/1613881-initwithdelegate
## but the headers are not decorated
!extra-designated-initializer! EAWiFiUnconfiguredAccessoryBrowser::initWithDelegate:queue: is incorrectly decorated with an [DesignatedInitializer] attribute
